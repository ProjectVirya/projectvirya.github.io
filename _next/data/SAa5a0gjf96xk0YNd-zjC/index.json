Virya provides a safe space to  express ourselves, share our stories, and connect with caregivers and other like-minded  people. This program entails meeting couple times a month to discuss their issues. Each  month has a different theme. Counselors and group members provide regular motivation  and check-ins. They say that having a safe space allows us to feel respected and supported,  so let's work together to create one. </p>"},{"data":{"title":"Journey","image":{"src":"images/consult.jpg","attribution":"Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@rosiesun?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Rosie Sun</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/rTwhmFSoXC8?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a>"},"feature":true,"excerpt":"","order":2,"date":"","slug":"_data/home/how-it-started"},"content":"<p>In 2019, I felt very low and felt that I didnt have a future, wasnt good at anything in additional to the covid stress. My mental health detoriated. It hits you all of a sudden. It’s the middle of the day, you’re surrounded by friends and the sun is out. But something isn’t right. There is this feeling, a very uncomfortable feeling in your mind, in the pit of your stomach. You want to leave and go somewhere that is quiet and dark.</p>\n<p>I always thoughts my problems were big. I always thought I was alone in this journey. When I was doing my therapy session with my therapist, I always used to ask him if there’s anyone who is going through the same thing. I would ask him whether he would connect me to that person who is going through the same things as I was going. Because that time , I was desperately trying to find someone who ì would relate or feel that I wasnt alone in this world and theres is light, healing and hope.</p>\n<p>I couldn’t speak to my parents about it because I thought I would be a disappointment , was scared of their reactions, will be angry or won’t take me seriously. Like me, many other struggle to express about their mental health with their parents for various reasons which is why we don’t have money to go to therapy. the therapy fees are very expensive. As students are not earning money, which is why lot of them don’t get to go the therapy sessions.</p>\n<p>In this way my friend and I decided to create a platform where people experiencing similar issues could connect and support one another, with the assistance of a therapist.</p>"}],"features":[{"data":{"title":"Current Happenings","image":{"src":"/images/hero.jpg","attribution":"Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@youssefnaddam?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">youssef naddam</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/iJ2IG8ckCpA?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a>"},"feature":true,"excerpt":"Each session begins and ends with check-in and check-outs","order":2,"date":"","slug":"_data/features/current-happenings"},"content":"<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Each session begins and ends with check-in and check-outs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pre-information for not attending a session with a valid reason is given by clients at least 48 hours before the session.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>At least four weeks of attendance is compulsory for the clients.
