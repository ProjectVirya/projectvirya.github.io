Hormonal imbalances and\ngenetics may also play a role.</p>\n<p>To treat winter depression, doctors may recommend light therapy, which involves sitting in front\nof a special light box for a certain amount of time each day to help regulate the body's internal\nclock. Antidepressant medications and psychotherapy can also be effective treatments for\nwinter depression.</p>\n<p>There are also several things that people can do on their own to help alleviate winter\ndepression, such as getting outside for at least a few minutes each day, even when it's cloudy,\nto expose yourself to natural light; exercising regularly; and eating a healthy, balanced diet.\nIf you are experiencing symptoms of winter depression, it is important to seek help from a\nmental health professional.
