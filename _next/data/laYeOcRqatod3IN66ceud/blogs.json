But if we can get past that feeling and try it on our own, it can be very beneficial. In group therapy, you have the opportunity to lean into feeling accepted by others while also challenging yourself to make your needs known. This can include pushing yourself out of your comfort zone and speaking in front of a group, as well as giving yourself validation that you were heard. <strong>According to one 2019 study, group therapy can be especially beneficial when dealing with social anxiety and life transitions.</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>One of the most important advantages is discovering that you are not alone in your suffering.

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused the situation to worsen. The estimated prevalence of mental disorders in Nepal's 29 million inhabitants is over 4%, or roughly 1.1 million people, with an additional 5.2% of 13–18-year-olds. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused the situation to worsen\nHalf of the respondents to a study from 2020 that tracked the psychosocial status of Nepalese people during the pandemic reported experiencing at least one psychological symptom. The study was based on data gathered online between 23 April 2020 and 3 May 2020. Similarly, Data provided by the Nepal Police also indicated an increase in suicide deaths, with 16 to 18 occurring every day in 2020.</p>\n<p>The overall physical, mental, spiritual, and social well-being has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic's lockdown, curfews, isolation from others, and quarantine.\nMental disorders in children and adolescents are prevalent and have been linked to early death and severe adult dysfunction. Three-quarters of all mental disorders begin before the age of 25 and about half by the age of 14. Around 10–20% of children and adolescents worldwide have mental disorders; similar disorders, such as anxiety disorders, behavior disorders, and mood disorders, are common across cultures. A low-income nation, Nepal has a population of around 20 million people, of whom 40% (12 million) are under the age of 18 .</p>\n<p>About 15-20% of this population, or 2 to 3 million people, may have a mental disorder, according to the Ministry of Health and Population of Nepal . Globally, the prevalence and disease burden of mental disorders continue to be astronomically high. There is a sizable treatment gap for mental illness everywhere in the world. In low- and middle-income countries, between 76% and 85% of individuals with severe mental disorders do not receive any treatment. In Nepal, the severity, suffering, and financial toll caused by mental illnesses as well as the associated costs to individuals, families, and societies are mind-boggling. In the Kathmandu Valley, the first epidemiological field survey carried out in 1984 estimated that the prevalence of mental illness was around 14 percent.</p>\n<p>According to the multi-sectoral action plan for the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases (2014–2020), the burden of mental illness accounts for 18% of NCDs. Since the current estimates of mental health issues are based on small-scale urban studies, it is impossible to generalize the findings to the entire country. The lack of national-level data on the prevalence of mental disorders and unmet service needs has further restricted policy discussions on the needs of the Nepalese population in terms of mental health.\nConsequently, a national population-based survey on mental health is required. 10% of adults reported having experienced a mental disorder in the past, and 4.3% reported having one right now.</p>\n<p>About one-fourth (23%) of adults who had mental disorders sought treatment of some kind.\nMajor depressive disorder (MDD) prevalence was estimated by GBD in 2019 23 to be 3.6% in Nepal, 2.6% in South Asia, and 2.5% globally. In Nepal, the prevalence of MDD is higher in women than in men (4.3% vs. 2.8%), and it is more common (7.6%) in older populations. Epilepsy, schizophrenia, alcohol use disorders, and bipolar disorder prevalence estimates in Nepal are comparable to regional and international estimates.</p>\n<p>Alcohol use disorders are far more common in men (2.4%) than in women (0.1%). In Nepal, the estimated prevalence of drug use disorders is estimated to be 0.4%, which is lower than the global estimate of 0.8% but comparable to regional estimates of 0.5%. In Nepal, there are more suicide deaths among men than among women (20.7 vs. 3.3/per 100,000 people). 23 Despite the need for more systematic data collection, there is evidence that the COVID-19 epidemic contributed to a 14% rise in suicide rates last year (compared to the prior year, according to Nepal Police records).</p>\n<p>Source credit: <a href=\"https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/mental-health/special-initiative/who-special-initiative-country-report---nepal---2022.pdf?sfvrsn=714028db_3&#x26;download=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nepal WHO Special Initiative for Mental Health Situational Assessment</a></p>"},{"data":{"title":"Introduction to Cognitive Behavioural Thinking (CBT)","image":{"src":"/images/CBT.jpg","attribution":"Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@_circadian_rhythm?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Ryan Gagnon</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/-pGEFxRYY3E?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a>"},"feature":false,"excerpt":"CBT is a form of psychotherapy that focuses on identifying and changing negative thoughts and behaviours in order to improve mood and overall well-being.","order":1,"date":"28 Dec, 2022","slug":"blogs/22-12-28/Introduction-to-cognitive-behavioural-thinking"},"content":"<p>Depression can be a challenging and overwhelming experience, leaving individuals feeling\nstuck and helpless in their negative thoughts and emotions. However, there is hope and\neffective treatment options available, such as Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT).</p>\n<p>CBT is a form of psychotherapy that focuses on identifying and changing negative thoughts\nand behaviours in order to improve mood and overall well-being. It was developed by Aaron\nBeck in the 1960s and has since become a widely used and evidence-based treatment for a\nvariety of mental health conditions, including depression, anxiety disorders, eating disorders,\nsubstance abuse disorders, and personality disorders.</p>\n<p>One of the key techniques used in CBT is \"homework\" assignments, which involve the client\nengaging in specific activities or tasks outside of therapy sessions. These activities can\ninclude keeping a record of moods and thoughts, or engaging in enjoyable activities for a\nspecific amount of time each day. The aim of these assignments is to help the client develop\nnew skills and habits to cope with stress and negative emotions more effectively.</p>\n<p>CBT can also help individuals identify and challenge cognitive distortions, or \"thinking errors\"\nthat can contribute to negative thoughts and emotions. Examples of cognitive distortions\ninclude black-and-white thinking, jumping to conclusions, personalization, should\nstatements, mental filter, overgeneralization, magnification and minimization, fortune-telling,\ncomparison, catastrophizing, labeling, and disqualifying the positive.</p>\n<p>CBT typically lasts for several weeks or months and is designed to teach clients skills that\nthey can use throughout their lives to manage their mental health. An example of the\neffectiveness of CBT is the case of Sarah, a 19-year-old college student struggling with\ndepression. Through CBT, Sarah was able to identify and challenge negative beliefs and\nfocus on her strengths and passions, leading to an improvement in her depression and a\nsense of purpose and meaning in her life.</p>\n<p>Overall, CBT is a highly effective treatment for a wide range of mental health conditions and\ncan be a powerful tool in helping individuals overcome depression and improve their overall\nwell-being. So, it is a great way to overcome depression and lead a happy life.</p>"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
