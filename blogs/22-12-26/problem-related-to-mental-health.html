The COVID-19 pandemic has caused the situation to worsen. The estimated prevalence of mental disorders in Nepal's 29 million inhabitants is over 4%, or roughly 1.1 million people, with an additional 5.2% of 13–18-year-olds. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused the situation to worsen
Half of the respondents to a study from 2020 that tracked the psychosocial status of Nepalese people during the pandemic reported experiencing at least one psychological symptom. The study was based on data gathered online between 23 April 2020 and 3 May 2020. Similarly, Data provided by the Nepal Police also indicated an increase in suicide deaths, with 16 to 18 occurring every day in 2020.</p>
<p>The overall physical, mental, spiritual, and social well-being has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic's lockdown, curfews, isolation from others, and quarantine.
Mental disorders in children and adolescents are prevalent and have been linked to early death and severe adult dysfunction. Three-quarters of all mental disorders begin before the age of 25 and about half by the age of 14. Around 10–20% of children and adolescents worldwide have mental disorders; similar disorders, such as anxiety disorders, behavior disorders, and mood disorders, are common across cultures. A low-income nation, Nepal has a population of around 20 million people, of whom 40% (12 million) are under the age of 18 .</p>
<p>About 15-20% of this population, or 2 to 3 million people, may have a mental disorder, according to the Ministry of Health and Population of Nepal . Globally, the prevalence and disease burden of mental disorders continue to be astronomically high. There is a sizable treatment gap for mental illness everywhere in the world. In low- and middle-income countries, between 76% and 85% of individuals with severe mental disorders do not receive any treatment. In Nepal, the severity, suffering, and financial toll caused by mental illnesses as well as the associated costs to individuals, families, and societies are mind-boggling. In the Kathmandu Valley, the first epidemiological field survey carried out in 1984 estimated that the prevalence of mental illness was around 14 percent.</p>
<p>According to the multi-sectoral action plan for the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases (2014–2020), the burden of mental illness accounts for 18% of NCDs. Since the current estimates of mental health issues are based on small-scale urban studies, it is impossible to generalize the findings to the entire country. The lack of national-level data on the prevalence of mental disorders and unmet service needs has further restricted policy discussions on the needs of the Nepalese population in terms of mental health.
Consequently, a national population-based survey on mental health is required. 10% of adults reported having experienced a mental disorder in the past, and 4.3% reported having one right now.</p>
<p>About one-fourth (23%) of adults who had mental disorders sought treatment of some kind.
Major depressive disorder (MDD) prevalence was estimated by GBD in 2019 23 to be 3.6% in Nepal, 2.6% in South Asia, and 2.5% globally. In Nepal, the prevalence of MDD is higher in women than in men (4.3% vs. 2.8%), and it is more common (7.6%) in older populations. Epilepsy, schizophrenia, alcohol use disorders, and bipolar disorder prevalence estimates in Nepal are comparable to regional and international estimates.</p>
<p>Alcohol use disorders are far more common in men (2.4%) than in women (0.1%). In Nepal, the estimated prevalence of drug use disorders is estimated to be 0.4%, which is lower than the global estimate of 0.8% but comparable to regional estimates of 0.5%. In Nepal, there are more suicide deaths among men than among women (20.7 vs. 3.3/per 100,000 people). 23 Despite the need for more systematic data collection, there is evidence that the COVID-19 epidemic contributed to a 14% rise in suicide rates last year (compared to the prior year, according to Nepal Police records).</p>
