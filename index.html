My mental health detoriated. It hits you all of a sudden. It’s the middle of the day, you’re surrounded by friends and the sun is out. But something isn’t right. There is this feeling, a very uncomfortable feeling in your mind, in the pit of your stomach. You want to leave and go somewhere that is quiet and dark.</p>
<p>I always thoughts my problems were big. I always thought I was alone in this journey. When I was doing my therapy session with my therapist, I always used to ask him if there’s anyone who is going through the same thing. I would ask him whether he would connect me to that person who is going through the same things as I was going. Because that time , I was desperately trying to find someone who ì would relate or feel that I wasnt alone in this world and theres is light, healing and hope.</p>
<p>I couldn’t speak to my parents about it because I thought I would be a disappointment , was scared of their reactions, will be angry or won’t take me seriously. Like me, many other struggle to express about their mental health with their parents for various reasons which is why we don’t have money to go to therapy. the therapy fees are very expensive. As students are not earning money, which is why lot of them don’t get to go the therapy sessions.</p>
<p>In this way my friend and I decided to create a platform where people experiencing similar issues could connect and support one another, with the assistance of a therapist.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full p-16 mx-auto flex items-center justify-center bg-virya"><button class="hover:bg-virya font-bold px-3 py-2 border-2  hover:text-white rounded-full bg-white text-virya border-virya hover:border-white">Let&#x27;s Get Started</button></div><div class="flex flex-col md:items-center justify-center mt-28 mb-10 "><span class="text-virya font-bold">Features</span><span class="text-3xl font-black my-2">Why Project Vīrya?</span><span class="font-normal text-gray-600 md:text-center lg:w-2/3">♥ ♥ ♥</span></div><div class="grid lg:w-4/6 mx-auto grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2 lg:gap-8 mb-28"><div class="flex items-stretch justify-center  relative mb-6 lg:mb-0"><div class="rounded-3xl w-full flex items-end  lg:h-full min-h-96 h-96  bg-cover bg-clip-padding lg:bg-fit bg-center bg-no-repeat border group" style="background-image:url(&quot;/images/hero.jpg&quot;)"><div class="bg-transparent-semi py-1 px-2 rounded-sm text-white mb-6 text-xs hidden group-hover:block">Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@youssefnaddam?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">youssef naddam</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/iJ2IG8ckCpA?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></div></div></div><div class=" flex items-center justify-center"><div><h1 class="font-black text-2xl " title="Current Happenings">Current Happenings</h1><div class="HtmlRender_markdown__dTZWD "><ul>

<p>Each session begins and ends with check-in and check-outs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pre-information for not attending a session with a valid reason is given by clients at least 48 hours before the session.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At least four weeks of attendance is compulsory for the clients. The methods and ways of leading the session depend upon the idea of the facilitator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have 30 people who have filled out the form for group therapy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Out of 30, there are people ranging from 17 years of age to 37 years of age.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have divided the group based on the appropriate age and their problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have 6 groups in total for now for group therapy which will be conducted by both online and physical mediums based on their preference.</p>
</li>

<p>In addition to this, we also have started an addiction support group and career related support group,</p>
